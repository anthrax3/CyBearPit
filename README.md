## Background

The CyBearPit is a piece of infrastructure at Baylor University used to host network defense competitions. This repository holds various configuration items related to that infrastructure, as well as the [BeanPoll](beanpoll "BeanPoll") scoring engine.

CyBearPit (or at least the portions of its code and configuration documented here) is basically a [ProxMox](https://pve.proxmox.com "ProxMox Virtual Environment") virtualization cluster (code in the [pve](pve "ProxMox") folder), a set of network hardware (code in the [network](network "CyBearPit network") folder), and the BeanPoll scoring engine (Java code in the [beanpoll](beanpoll "BeanPoll") folder and Docker scripting in the [containers](containers "BeanPoll containers") folder).

## Usage

Using the actual CyBearPit is restricted, but you might be interested in [BeanPoll](beanpoll "BeanPoll"), which is a scoring engine that is entirely portable to any network setup.
